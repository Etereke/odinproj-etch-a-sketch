# odin-etch-a-sketch

The first big JavaScript exercise in The Odin Project. The task was to build a sketchpad/Etch-a-Sketch hybrid that the user can draw on by hovering over it with his cursor.

## Mandatory functions

- User can color the canvas by hovering over it
- User can set the resolution by clicking a button and entering a number between 2 and 100 in the popup prompt window

## Extra functions

- User can change pen color via a color selector
- Hovering over pixels that were previously hovered over with the same color results in 10% darkening of the pixel
- Added a range input element that the user can use to erase the corresponding column of the canvas by dragging the input element to either side (like in those children drawing board toys)
